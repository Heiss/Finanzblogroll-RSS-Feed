# Finanzblogroll-RSS-Feed

This repository generates a rss feed from the [finanzblogroll](https://finanzblogroll.de/rss-feed/) website.

With github actions, this repository generates every hour a new feed, which can be found on gist. You can enter this feed to your favourite rss reader.

If you want to run it manually, you can execute `python parse.py`.
